PA10 Run instructions

Follow the following instructions to compile and run the code:

In the 'CS680_Haile/PA9' directory, execute the following commands:

```  
mkdir build  
cd build  
cmake ..  
make  
```  
_  
_  
Instructions for executing:  
run the command ./Tutorial  
_  
The dimness of the scene, as well as the dimness of the ambient lighting can  
be specified by command line arguments. The specification is made using the  
following format:  
_  
./Tutorial |dimness| |ambient dimness|  
where |dimness| is input for the dimness of the scene and |ambient dimness| is
input for the dimness of the ambient lighting. Both must be numerical values  
_  
If the user wishes to only change ambient dimness, specify 1 for dimness, then  
specify the ambient dimness value. If the user wishes to only change dimness, 
only specify the dimness value. If the user doesn't wish to change any values,
simply execute ./Tutorial by itself.  
_  
If the user wishes to change the specular brightness of a given object, they can
change the brightness by accessing the mtl file of a given object and changing
the Ns attribute. The higher the Ns, the brighter the specular highlight the
object gives off.
