Follow the following instructions to compile and run the code:

2. Execute the command cd build
3. Execute the command cmake ..
4. Execute the command make    



Instructions for executing
The program accepts command line arguments that specify an obj and/or mtl file.  
The format of the execution of the program follows:  
./Tutorial (obj file name) (mtl file name), where (obj file name) and  
(mtl file name) each specify a file of the respective type. For example,  
"./Tutorial box.obj box.mtl" will display a box object in accordance with  
the specified obj and mtl file.    

If the user wants to use his/her own objects, they can move their objects into  
the objects directory of PA4 and specify those objects when running the program.    

The program is able to run with only a obj file  
(e.g. command: "./Tutorial box.obj" will work)
